# mini-dash-app-template

* This is a bare bones template for a structured dash app based on the following post by Anmol Tomar: https://towardsdatascience.com/dash-for-beginners-create-interactive-python-dashboards-338bfcb6ffa4

* The value for me is the explicit comments and structure that allows me to build bigger apps more easily from this starting point.

* The only added feature of note is the ability to automatically run from either the command line or in a Jupyter notebook.
